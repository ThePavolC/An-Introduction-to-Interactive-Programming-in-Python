For our last mini-project, we will complete the implementation of RiceRocks, an updated version of Asteroids,  that we began last week.  You may start with either your code or the program template which includes a full implementation of Spaceship and will be released immediately after the deadline for the Spaceship mini-project (by making the preceding link live).  If you start with your own code, you should add the splash screen image that you dismiss with a mouse click before starting this mini-project.  We strongly recommend using Chrome for this mini-project since Chrome's superior performance will become apparent when you program attempts to draw dozens of sprites.
